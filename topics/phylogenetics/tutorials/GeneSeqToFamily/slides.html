# GeneSeqToFamily:
Discovery and Visualisation of Homologous Genes and Gene Families Using Galaxy

---

### Gene family

A gene family is a set of several similar genes
- formed by duplication of a single original gene
The study of homologous genes
- Helps to understand the evolution of gene families
Various tools available but they provide overview of homology at family level information
- MSOAR, OrthoMCL, HomoloGene
They can not provide information about structural changes within gene

### Ensembl GeneTree pipeline    

The Ensembl GeneTrees computational pipeline 
- Generates gene families based on coding sequences
- Provides details about exon conservation
It uses various tools: 
- BLAST
- hcluster_sg
- T-Coffee
- TreeBeST

The Ensembl GeneTrees computational pipeline 
- Generates gene families based on coding sequences
- Provides details about exon conservation
It uses various tools: 
- BLAST
- hcluster_sg
- T-Coffee
- TreeBeST

Most tools are:
- Specific to certain computing environments
- Only usable via the command line
- Require many dependencies to be fulfilled
- Creates Ensembl Compara database for results
